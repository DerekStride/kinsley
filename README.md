As a follow up to my implmentation of [monkey](https://github.com/derekstride/monkey) in Rust, I've branched out to build
my own language implmentation. The focus of this project isn't to get a working language with features x, y, and z. It's
to explore compiler and virtual machine optimization. I would like each aspect of the features I implement to be
as well thought out and understood occasionally diving into the latest research on that topic.

Some guiding principles:

1. Explore - Prefer diving deep into a subject.
2. Performance - Prefer diving into optimizations over features.

## Register Allocation

For an example of the types of problems I've been exploring check out this blog post on [Register Allocation by Chris
Seaton](https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/register-allocation/). I'm building a register based virtual machine so I
implemented a Register allocator for compacting the registers used throughout the program. You can see a before and
after view of the registers live ranges used by compiler by running the `bin/register_reallocator.rs` program.
